## Summary
This repository was created to share the code of my contribution to the 6 hour build challenge.
This challenge taken on by [Habitor](https://horizon.meta.com/world/10162781682563570).
I decided to join in the challenge as well by creating **Bubble Popper**.

To create this world, I used the Meta Worlds Desktop Editor + VS Code Insiders.
- The models were generated using the Desktop Editor mesh genAI capabilities.
- The Game Design Document (GDD) was generated using Gemini 2.5 Pro.
- The code was generated using o4-mini in Agent mode. (Later, switching to Claude Sonnet 3.7 to fix up any issues)
  - Both of these AI models are available in the models drop down of Github Copilot.

The coding models were prompted to reference [my Worlds Snippets](https://github.com/tellous/HorizonWorldsSnippets) in order to write _better_ code. 

It did still require some final clean up on my end.

**Disclaimer**: This code is likely not complete and has bugs. I still think it is still worth showing the process.

## Project Structure
- GDD.md - The doc created by me prompting based on my requirements.
- *.ts - The component and modules generated by the Agent referencing both the GDD and HorizonWorldsSnippets.

## Notes
Feel free to use any of this logic if it is helpful in any way.
